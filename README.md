# BasicTaskManagerApp
This is a basic Task Manager console application that performs basic task operations: Add, Edit, Delete, View. It will also mark tasks as completed and saves tasks to a file and load them upon startup. This project was created to showcase my ability to use of collections, file handling, and basic UI in a console application.
